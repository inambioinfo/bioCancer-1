> Simulation for decision analysis

Start by selecting the types of variables to use in the analysis from the `Select types` dropdown in the _Simulate_ tab. Available types include Constant, Binomial, Discrete, Normal, Uniform, and Sequence.

### Constant

List the constants to include in the analysis in the `Constant variables` input. You can either enter names and values directly into the text area (e.g., "cost 3") or enter a name ("cost") and a value (5) in the `Name` and `Value` input respectively and then press the <i title='Add variable' href='#' class='fa fa-plus-circle'></i> icon. Press the <i title='Remove variable' href='#' class='fa fa-minus-circle'></i> icon to remove a variable. Note that only variables listed in the (larger) text-input boxes will be included in the simulation.

### Binomial

Add random variables with a binomial distribution using the `Binomial variables` inputs. Start by specifying a `Name` ("crash"), the number of trials (n) (e.g., 20) and the probability (p) of a "success" (.01). Then press the <i title='Add variable' href='#' class='fa fa-plus-circle'></i> icon. Alternatively, enter (or remove) input directly in text area (e.g., crash 20 .01).

### Discrete

Define random variables with a discrete distribution using the `Discrete variables` inputs. Start by specifying a `Name` ("price"), the values (6 8), and their associated probabilities (.3 .7). Then press the <i title='Add variable' href='#' class='fa fa-plus-circle'></i> icon. Alternatively, enter (or remove) input directly in text area (e.g., price 6 8 .3 .7). Note that the probabilities must sum to 1. If not, a message will be displayed and the simulation cannot be run.

### Normal

To include normally distributed random variables in the analysis select `Normal` from the `Select types` dropdown and use `Normal variables` inputs. For example, enter a `Name` ("demand"), the `Mean` (1000) and the standard deviation (`St.dev.`, 100). Then press the <i title='Add variable' href='#' class='fa fa-plus-circle'></i> icon. Alternatively, enter (or remove) input directly in text area (e.g., "demand 1000 100").

### Uniform

To include uniformly distributed random variables in the analysis select `Uniform` from the `Select types` dropdown. Provide parameters in the `Uniform variables` inputs. For example, enter a `Name` ("cost"), the `Min` (10) and the `Max` (15) value. Then press the <i title='Add variable' href='#' class='fa fa-plus-circle'></i> icon. Alternatively, enter (or remove) input directly in text area (e.g., "cost 10 15").

### Sequence

To include a sequence of values select `Sequence` from the `Select types` dropdown. Provide the minimum and maximum values in the `Sequence variables` inputs. For example, enter a `Name` ("trend"), the `Min` (1) and the `Max` (1000) value. Note that the number of 'steps' is determined by the number of simulations. Then press the <i title='Add variable' href='#' class='fa fa-plus-circle'></i> icon. Alternatively, enter (or remove) input directly in text area (e.g., "trend 1 1000").

### Formulas

To perform a calculation using the generated variables create a formula in the `Simulation formulas` input box in the main panel (e.g., "profit = demand * (price - cost)"). Formulas are used to add new variables to the simulation or to update existing variables. You must specify the name of the new variable to the left of a `=` sign. Variable names can contain letters, numbers, and `_` but no other characters or spaces. You can enter multiple formulas. If, for example, you would also like to calculate the margin in each simulation press `return` after the first formula and type "margin = price - cost".

Many of the same functions used with `Create` in the _Data > Transform_ tab and in `Filters` in _Data > View_ can also be included in formulas. You can use `>` and `<` signs and combine them. For example `x > 3 & y == 2` would evaluate as "TRUE" when the variable `x` has values larger than 3 **AND** `y` has values equal to 2. Recall that in R, and most other programming languages, `=` is used to _assign_ a value and `==` to evaluate if the value of a variable is exactly equal to some other value. In contrast `!=` is used to determine if a variable is _unequal_ to some value. You can also use expressions that have an **OR** condition. For example, to determine when `Salary` is smaller than \$100,000 **OR** larger than \$20,000 use `Salary > 20000 | Salary < 100000`. `|` is the symbol for **OR** and `&` is the symbol for **AND** (see also the help file for _Data > View_).

A few additional examples of formulas are shown below:

1. Create a new variable z that is the difference between variables x and y

	z = x - y

2. Create a new `logical` variable z that takes on the value TRUE when x > y and FALSE otherwise

	z = x > y

3. Create a new `logical` z that takes on the value TRUE when x is equal to y and FALSE otherwise

	z = x == y

4. The command above is equivalent to the one below using `ifelse`. Note the similarity to `if` statements in Excel

	z = ifelse(x < y, TRUE, FALSE)

5. `ifelse` statements can be used to create more complex (numeric) variables as well. In the example below, z will take on the value 0 if x is smaller than 60. If x is larger than 100 z is set equal to 1. Finally, when x is 60, 100, or between 60 and 100, z is set to 2. **Note:** make sure to include the appropriate number of opening `(` and closing `)` brackets

	z = ifelse(x < 60, 0, ifelse(x > 100, 1, 2))

6. To create a new variable z that is a transformation of variable x but with mean equal to zero:

	z = x - mean(x)

7. To determine the minimum (maximum) value for each pair of values across two columns in the data (e.g., x and y) use the functions `pmin` and `pmax`. In the example below, z will take on the value of x when x is larger than y and take on the value of y otherwise

	z = pmax(x,y)

See the table below for an example:

```{r results = 'asis', echo = FALSE}
x <- c(1,2,3,4,5)
y <- c(0,3,8,2,10)
tab_large <- "class='table table-condensed table-hover' style='width:40%;'"
data.frame(
  x = x,
  y = y,
  `pmax(x,y)` = pmax(x,y),
 	check.names = FALSE
) %>%
knitr::kable(align = 'l', format = 'html', escape = FALSE, table.attr = tab_large)
```

### Running the simulation

The value shown in the `# sims` input determines the number of simulation _draws_. To redo a simulation with the same randomly generated values, specify a number in the `Set random seed` input (e.g., 1234).

To save the simulated data for further analysis specify a name in the `Simulated data` input box. You can then investigate the simulated data by choosing the data with the specified name from the `Datasets` dropdown in any of the _Data_ tabs (e.g., _Data > View_, _Data > Visualize_, or _Data > Explore_).

When all required inputs have been specified press the `Simulate` button to run the simulation.

In the screen shot below `var_cost` and `fixed_cost` are specified as constants. `demand` is normally distributed with a mean of 1000 and a standard deviation of 100. `price` is a discrete random variable that is set to \$5 (30% probability) or $8 (70% probability). There are three formulas in the `Simulation formulas` text-input. The first updates `demand` to establish a dependence on the simulated variable `price`. The second formula specifies the profit function. The final formula is used to determine the number (and proportion) of cases where profit is below 100. The result is assigned to a new variable `profit_small`.

In the output under `Simulation summary` we first see details on the specification of the simulation (e.g., the number of simulation runs). The section `Constants` lists the value of variables that do not vary across simulation runs. The sections `Random variables` and `Logicals` list the outcomes of the simulation. We see that average `demand` in the simulation is 627.940 with a standard deviation of 109.323. Other characteristics of the simulated data are also provided (e.g., the maximum profit is 1758.770). Finally, we see that the probability of `profits` below 100 is equal 0.315 (i.e., profits were below 100 in 315 out of the 1000 simulations).

Histograms of of the random variables as well as the variables created using `Simulation formulas` are shown in the main panel under `Simulation plots`.

Because we specified a name in the `Simulated data` box the data are available as `simdat` within Radiant (see screen shots below). To use the data in Excel click the download icon on the top-right of the screen in the _Data > View_ tab or go to the _Data > Manage_ tab and save the data to a csv file (or use the clipboard feature). For more information see the help file for the _Data > Manage_ tab.

## Repeating the simulation

Suppose the simulation discussed above was used to get a better understanding of daily profits. To develop insights into annual profits we could re-run the simulation 365 times. This can be done easily by using the functionality available in the _Repeat_ tab. First, select the `Variables to re-simulate`, here `demand` and `price`. Then select the variable(s) of interest in the `Output variables` box (e.g., `profit`). Set `# runs` to 365.

Next, we need to determine how to summarize the data. If we select `Simulation` in `Group by` the data will be summarized **across** 365 repeated simulations resulting in 1000 values. If we select `Repeat` in `Group by` the data will be summarized **across** 1000 simulations resulting in 365 values. If you imagine the full set of repeated simulated data as a table with 1000 rows and 365 columns, grouping by `Simulation` will create a summary statistic for each row and grouping by `Repeat` will create a summary statistic for each column. In this example we want to determine the `sum` of simulated daily profits across 365 repetitions so we select `Simulation` in the `Group by` box and `sum` in the `Apply function` box.

To determine, the probability that annual profits are below \$36,500 we enter the formula below into the `Repeated simulation formula` text input.

`profit_365 = profit < 36500`

When you are done with the input values click the `Repeat` button. Because we specified a name for `Repeat data` two data sets will be created. "simdat_repeat" will have all elements of the repeated simulation (i.e., 1000 x 365 rows) and "simdat_repeat_sum" will have the summarized data grouped by simulation run. Note that the extension "_sum" was used because we selected `sum` from the `Apply function` dropdown.

Descriptive statistics for the repeated simulation are shown in the main panel under `Repeated simulation summary`. We see that the annual expected profit (i.e., the mean of `sum of profit`) for the company is 172311.8 with a standard deviation of 10772.29. Although we found above that daily profits can be below 100, the chance that profits are below $365 \times 100$ for the year are slim to none (i.e., the proportion of repeated simulations with annual profits below \$36,500 is equal to 0).

![sim output](figures_quant/simulater_repeat.png)

A histogram of annual profits (`sum of profit`) is shown in the main panel under `Repeated simulation plots`. There is no plot for `profit_365` because it only has one value (i.e., FALSE).
