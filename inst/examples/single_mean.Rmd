### Example `rmarkdown` report

Below is the output from Radiant used to evaluate if the average price in a sample of diamonds is greater than \$1000.

```{r echo=FALSE, comment=NA, fig.width=7, fig.height=7}
suppressMessages(library(radiant))
result <- single_mean(dataset = "diamonds", var = "price", comp_value = 1000,
                      alternative = "greater", conf_lev = 0.95)
summary(result)
plot(result)
```

### A few other rmarkdown features

You can even include math.

$$f(\alpha, \beta) \propto x^{\alpha-1}(1-x)^{\beta-1}$$
