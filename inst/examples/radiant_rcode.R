## this result will differ from the previous one because the data from radiant
## is used which includes only a subset of all diamond prices for illustration
## purposes
## if you get an error here - run the previous command, and follow the
## instructions in the comment

## if the salary data was loaded in radiant you should get output here
result <- compare_means("salary", "rank", "salary")
summary(result)
plot(result, plots = c("bar","density"))

## should produce an error because no dataset with that name exists

## set working directory to Desktop - checking two possible locations
path2desktop <- "~/Desktop/"
if (!file.exists(path2desktop))
	path2desktop <- "~/Documents/Desktop"
setwd(path2desktop)

## get the data from the link below and save it to your desktop
browseURL("https://github.com/vnijs/radiant/blob/master/inst/marketing/data/shopping.rda?raw=true")

## load example dataset, if the file is not found make sure your working directory
## is set to Desktop
load("shopping.rda")

## start with hierarchical clustering, view help
?hier_clus

## run hierarchical cluster analysis on the shopping data, variables v1 through v6
result <- hier_clus("shopping", "v1:v6")

## summary - not much here - plots are more important
summary(result)

## check the help file on how to plot results from hierarchical cluster analysis
?plot.hier_clus

## default plots
plot(result)

## show the dendrogram
plot(result, plots = "dendro")

## show the dendrogram with cutoff at 0
plot(result, plots = "dendro", cutoff = 0)

## there seems to be three clusters (segments)
result <- kmeans_clus("shopping", vars = "v1:v6", nr_clus = 3)
summary(result)
plot(result)

## to add a variable with segment membership information to the shopping dataset
save_membership(result)

## did that work? there should be a column 'kclus3' in the dataset
getdata("shopping") %>% head

## to save the average shopping attitude scores for each segment
write.csv(result$clus_means, file = "kmeans.csv")

## the following command should open the created csv file in Excel
browseURL("kmeans.csv")

## see if you can reproduce this output in radiant's web-interface
## the shopping data should be loaded from the global environment
radiant()

## if you use Quit > Quit to stop radiant the app will dump the current state
## into the global environment if you start radiant again it will read the state
## information and you can continue where you left-off. To reset to a clean state
## go to Quit and hit the reset button

## to unload radiant ...
## detach("package:radiant", unload=TRUE)
